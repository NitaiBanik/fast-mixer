# Fast Mixer

This is an ongoing project using [google/oboe](https://github.com/google/oboe) c++ library. This is going to be an easy to use mixer for recorded streams and external audio files. I want to credit [sheraz-nadeem/oboe_recorder_sample](https://github.com/sheraz-nadeem/oboe_recorder_sample) for understanding the required structure of such a project.

To run this project install NDK and CMake in Android Studio.

This project uses some C++ projects (oboe and libsndfile) as submodules. After cloning run below command,

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

to download all of the C++ dependencies required by this project. Then this project can be built and run.

This README.md file will further be enhanced later.
